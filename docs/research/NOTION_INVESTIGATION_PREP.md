# Notion Investigation - Preparation and Requirements

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Research complete, ready for hands-on testing

---

## Executive Summary: Initial Research Findings

### ❌ No Official Notion CLI

Notion does NOT have an official CLI. However:

- Several community-created CLI tools exist (Python, Go, TypeScript, npm packages)
- All use Notion's official API
- None are officially maintained by Notion

### ⚠️ Notion API Search is LIMITED

**Critical Finding:** Notion's search API is **significantly weaker** than GitHub's:

- **Only searches titles** (not full content!)
- **No regex support** via API
- **No wildcard patterns**
- **No context lines**
- Searches only resources shared with integration

**Comparison:**

- GitHub search: ~17% of ripgrep's power (searches title + body)
- Notion API search: ~5% of ripgrep's power (title only, no regex)

### ✅ Notion API for Publishing/Reading is GOOD

- Create pages with content ✅
- Read page content (blocks) ✅
- Append blocks to pages ✅
- Update page properties ✅
- Recursive block reading supported ✅

---

## What I Found

### 1. Notion CLI Landscape

**Official:** ❌ None

**Community Tools:**

| Tool                      | Language     | Status      | Features                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| @iansinnott/notion-cli    | npm          | 4 years old | Search, databases, CSV import  |
| kris-hansen/notion-cli    | Python       | Active      | Todo management, official API  |
| litencatt/notion-cli      | TypeScript   | Active      | Interactive mode, multi-format |
| kris-hansen/notion-cli-go | Go           | Active      | Task management                |
| NotionExporter            | .NET/Windows | Active      | Export to JSON                 |

**Recommendation:** Would need to test or build custom tool

### 2. Notion API Search Capabilities

#### What Search API CAN Do:

- ✅ Search page/database titles
- ✅ Filter by object type (page or data_source)
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Returns shared resources

#### What Search API CANNOT Do:

- ❌ Search page content/body (only titles!)
- ❌ Regex patterns
- ❌ Wildcard searches
- ❌ Context lines
- ❌ Full-text search

#### Search Comparison Table

| Feature            | GitHub Search             | Notion API Search     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Search title       | ✅                        | ✅                    |
| Search body        | ✅                        | ❌ **Title only!**    |
| Regex              | ❌                        | ❌                    |
| Metadata filtering | ✅ (labels, dates, users) | ⚠️ (only object type) |
| Power level        | 17% of ripgrep            | **~5% of ripgrep**    |

**Critical:** Notion API search is **WORSE than GitHub** for text search!

### 3. Notion API Publishing (Creating Content)

#### Create Page Endpoint

```
POST https://api.notion.com/v1/pages
```

**Capabilities:**

- ✅ Create page with properties
- ✅ Add initial content (children blocks)
- ✅ Set parent (database or page)
- ✅ Rich formatting support

**Required:**

- Integration with Insert Content capability
- Parent page/database ID

#### Block Types Supported:

- Paragraph, headings (H1-H3)
- Lists (bulleted, numbered, todo)
- Code blocks (with language)
- Quotes, callouts
- Tables
- Embed, images, files
- Databases (inline, full-page)

---

### 4. Notion API Reading (Retrieving Content)

#### Retrieve Page

```
GET https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/{page_id}
```

Returns: Page properties and metadata

#### Retrieve Block Children

```
GET https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{block_id}/children
```

Returns: Content blocks (recursive required for nested content)

**Characteristics:**

- ✅ Structured block-based content
- ✅ Recursive traversal for complete content
- ✅ Rich metadata available
- ⚠️ Requires multiple API calls for deep nesting

---

## What I Need From You to Start Testing

### Required Information

#### 1. Notion API Key ⚠️ REQUIRED

I need a Notion integration API key to test.

**How to get:**

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Click "+ New integration"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Knowledge Base Testing")
4. Select your workspace
5. Copy the "Internal Integration Token"

**Provide:** The API key (starts with `secret_`)

**Security:** I will only use it for testing and NOT commit it to any files.

---

#### 2. Test Workspace/Page ⚠️ REQUIRED

I need a Notion page/database to test with.

**Option A: Create Test Database**

- Create a new database in Notion
- Share it with the integration (click "..." → "Add connections" → select your integration)
- Provide the database ID

**Option B: Create Test Page**

- Create a new page
- Share with integration
- Provide the page ID

**How to get Page/Database ID:**
From URL: `https://notion.so/workspace/PAGE_TITLE-<DATABASE_ID>?...`
The ID is the 32-character string after the title

**Provide:** Page/Database ID

---

#### 3. Testing Scope Preferences

Please tell me:

**What to test:**

- [ ] Create pages/content programmatically
- [ ] Read existing content
- [ ] Search capabilities
- [ ] Update existing pages
- [ ] Create database entries
- [ ] Query databases

**What NOT to touch:**

- Any existing pages/databases I should avoid
- Content I should not modify

---

#### 4. Use Case Clarification

**Your goal:** Use Notion as knowledge base instead of/alongside GitHub Issues

**Questions:**

1. **Would you be publishing knowledge TO Notion via CLI?**
   - If yes: How? (API, community CLI, custom script)

2. **Would Notion be primary or secondary?**
   - Primary: Main knowledge base
   - Secondary: Mirror/sync from GitHub

3. **What makes Notion attractive?**
   - Better web UI?
   - Existing team usage?
   - Better organization?
   - Search capabilities? (⚠️ API search is limited!)

4. **Critical consideration:**
   Notion's client app search is powerful (natural language, full content)
   BUT Notion's API search only searches titles (weaker than GitHub!)

---

## My Testing Plan (Once I Have Access)

### Phase 1: Basic API Testing (30 min)

- Authenticate with API key
- Create test page
- Read page content
- Update page
- Delete test content

### Phase 2: Search Testing (30 min)

- Test search by title
- Test search limitations (confirm no body search)
- Compare with local download + ripgrep approach
- Document exact capabilities

### Phase 3: Content Operations (1 hour)

- Create knowledge base entry
- Retrieve and parse content
- Test nested blocks (recursive reading)
- Test different block types
- Measure performance

### Phase 4: Comparison Analysis (1 hour)

- GitHub Issues vs Notion comprehensive comparison
- Search power comparison
- Publishing workflow comparison
- Reading/querying comparison
- Hybrid approach recommendations

### Phase 5: Build POC Tool (2 hours)

If viable:

- Create `notion-kb` CLI tool (similar to `gh-rg`)
- Implement: publish, search, read
- Test integration with existing workflow

---

## Preliminary Recommendation (Based on Research)

### ⚠️ Notion May NOT Be Better for Search

**Research shows:**

- Notion's **client app** search is excellent (natural language, full content)
- Notion's **API** search is worse than GitHub (title-only, no regex)

**For CLI/automated workflows:** GitHub + ripgrep is more powerful

**Hybrid Approach Possibility:**

1. Publish to BOTH GitHub and Notion
2. Search GitHub with `gh-rg` (full power)
3. Use Notion for visual browsing and collaboration

---

## Next Steps

**You provide:**

1. ✅ Notion API key (integration token)
2. ✅ Test page/database ID
3. ✅ Testing scope preferences
4. ✅ Use case clarification

**I will:**

1. Set up Notion API client
2. Execute comprehensive testing plan
3. Build comparison analysis
4. Create recommendation with POC tools if viable

---

## Security Notes

- API key will be stored securely (environment variable, not committed)
- Test data only (no production content)
- All test content will be clearly labeled
- Can delete all test content after testing

**Ready to start once you provide the required information above!**
