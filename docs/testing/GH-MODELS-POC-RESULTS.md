## Recommended Workflows

### 1. Daily Issue Triage (High Value)

```bash
# Get today's issues and summarize
gh search issues "repo:terrylica/knowledgebase created:$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" --json number,title,body | \
jq -c '.[]' | while read -r issue; do
    echo "=== Issue #$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.number') ==="
    gh models run "openai/gpt-4.1" "Summarize in 1 sentence: $(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.title + " - " + .body')"
done
```

**Value:** Save 5-10 minutes per day on issue review.

### 2. Auto-Labeling for New Issues (Medium Value)

```bash
# Suggest labels for unlabeled issues
gh issue list --label "!*" --json number,title,body | jq -c '.[]' | while read -r issue; do
    LABELS=$(gh label list --json name --jq '[.[].name] | join(", ")')
    SUGGESTION=$(gh models run "openai/gpt-4.1" "Suggest labels from: $LABELS for issue: $(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.title')")
    echo "Issue #$(echo "$issue" | jq -r '.number'): $SUGGESTION"
done
```

**Value:** Reduce manual labeling time by 70%.

### 3. Weekly Status Reports (High Value)

```bash
# Generate weekly report
ISSUES=$(gh search issues "repo:terrylica/knowledgebase updated:>=$(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)" --json number,title,state,labels)
gh models run "openai/gpt-4.1" "Generate a weekly status report from: $ISSUES"
```

**Value:** Automated team updates.

### 4. Knowledge Base Q&A Bot (Medium Value)

```bash
# Interactive Q&A
ask_kb() {
    CONTENT=$(gh api repos/terrylica/knowledgebase/contents/README.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d)
    gh models run "openai/gpt-4.1" "Based on this knowledge base: $CONTENT Answer: $1"
}

ask_kb "How do I search issues?"
```

**Value:** Faster onboarding, reduced documentation reading time.

---

## Limitations and Edge Cases

### 1. Large Documents

**Issue:** Can't process very large files in one call.  
**Workaround:** Chunk content or use `head -n 100` to limit size.

### 2. Rate Limiting

**Issue:** Free tier has usage quotas.  
**Workaround:** Add delays between requests, use caching.

### 3. Accuracy for Complex Tasks

**Issue:** Simple issues get 95%+ accuracy, complex ones may need review.  
**Workaround:** Always review AI suggestions before applying.

### 4. Batch Processing Speed

**Issue:** 3 sec/issue = 5 min for 100 issues.  
**Workaround:** Run as background job, don't use for real-time.

### 5. Model Selection

**Issue:** Different models have different strengths.  
**Workaround:** Test multiple models, pick best for each use case.
