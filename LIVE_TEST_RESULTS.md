## ✅ EDIT - Fully Tested

### Complete Edit Workflow

**Step 1: Created test issue**
```bash
gh issue create --title "TEST EDIT: Before Edit" --body "Original body text" --label bug
```
**Result:** ✅ Issue #64 created

**Step 2: Edited issue**

  --body "This body was updated via gh issue edit" \
  --add-label documentation
```

**Batch edited all at once:**
```bash
gh issue edit 66 67 68 --add-label tested
```
**Result:** ✅ All 3 issues updated with new label simultaneously

**Note:** Had to create 'tested' label first - labels must exist before use

gh issue delete 67 --yes  # ✅ Deleted
gh issue delete 68 --yes  # ✅ Deleted
```

**Verification:** All 3 issues confirmed deleted (queries return "Could not resolve" errors)
